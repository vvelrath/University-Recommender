### Idea

• Serve as a university guide for aspiring students 																					
• Students get a fair idea of the universities that match their requirements based on the test scores; this will help them save unnecessary application fee 																								
• The current application is for aspiring bachelor students. It can be extended to other levels of education

### Attributes Used

	University-name
	State
	Control (private or state)
	SAT Verbal
	SAT Math
	Expenses (in thousands)
	Percent financial aid
	Academics (on a scale of 1 to 5)
	Social (on a scale of 1 to 5)
	Quality of life (on a scale of 1 to 5)
	Academic emphasis

### Implementation

• Clustering : K-means, DBSCAN and weighted DBSCAN																					

• Attribute Weight assignment: Assign weights to attributes to reflect user preferences about the relative importance of each attribute							

• UI: User test scores and other attribute preferences are taken as input; based on which the weights are assigned dynamically
